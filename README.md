# Ishmael BasicApp Example
[Ishmael](https://github.com/bensyverson/Ishmael) is an isomorphic web app framework, which means the same app code can be run on the server and the browser. This example "freezes" and serves a very simple app via Express/node.js. The browser will get the static HTML version along with a JavaScript shim to "thaw" the entire app and revive it in place. The browser doesn't even need to re-render the page.

To run the demo:
 
     $ npm install
     $ node app.js

Then visit: [http://localhost:1851/app/](http://localhost:1851/app/)
